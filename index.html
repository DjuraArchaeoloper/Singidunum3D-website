    <h2>The future of experiencing the past</h2>
    <p>The global call for curators to digitize their collections was the fire which, on September 2nd, 2018, destroyed
      a great part of the collections in the National Museum in Brazil. Throughout the globe, curators have woken up and
      started to plan how to digitize the historical and archaeological collections, which implies, not only the
      archiving and the help of spreading information about heritage, but also creating of digital collections which can
      be printed in a 3D format and used as “surrogates”, in the case of the original ones being destroyed. Besides the
      most significant world institutions such as the British Museum and the Smithsonian Institute, and thanks to the
      availability of new technologies, it is more common that even smaller museums can now start their projects of
      virtualizing their collections.
      <br>
      <br>
      <span id="dots"></span><span id="more"> One such venture was started by the Belgrade city Museum through the
        project Singidunum 3D which encompassed the digitization of Singidunum’s antique heritage, a Roman city that was
        built on the place where Belgrade stands today. In the first phase of the project, 3D models of stone monuments
        with Latin inscriptions were made, which are located in the city parks of Belgrade, unmarked and extremely vague
        to the audience. In time, we have started the production of 3D models of smaller objects, parts of stone
        sculptures and bronze artifacts, and we even reconstructed some of them, showing their former appearance. While
        modeling, we have been relying on the IBM method (Image based modeling), which enables a photorealistic display
        of the object while their geometry was being fixed with the help of computer technologies. In this way, 3D
        models of high precision were achieved, realistic enough to draw the attention of the broad public but also
        geometrically accurate enough to satisfy the needs of interested scholars. That was precisely our aim, to gain
        new archive data for the Museum, which can be upgraded in the future with virtual reality experiences for the
        public, but also digital replicas which scholars can use in a digital surrounding, regardless of the boundaries
        and without the actual contact with the archaeological objects which are often sensitive and fragile.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is our way of popularizing the culture heritage of Singidinum.
        The 3D models from the Belgrade city Museum’s antique collection can be seen on the platform:

        The leader of the project, as a part of the Belgrade city Museum staff, is Milorad Ignjatović, the Antique
        collection’s curator, with the help of young associates, archaeologist Jugoslav Pendić and MA archaeologist
        Đurađ Đurić, and the support from the Ministry of Culture and Information of the Republic of Serbia.</span>
